<!--
7.11 Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept
track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording the number ofmiles driven and the number of gallons
used for each tankful. Develop a script that will take as input the miles driven and gallons used (both
as integers) for each tankful. The script should calculate and output HTML5 text that displays the
number of miles per gallon obtained for each tankful and prints the combined number of miles per
gallon obtained for all tankfuls up to this point. Use prompt dialogs to obtain the data from the user.
