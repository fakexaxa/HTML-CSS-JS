7.15 The process of finding the largest value (i.e., the maximum of a group of values) is used frequently
in computer applications. For example, a script that determines the winner of a sales contest
would input the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units
wins the contest. Write a pseudocode algorithm and then a script that inputs a series of 10 singledigit
numbers as characters, determines the largest of the numbers and outputs a message that displays
the largest number. Your script should use three variables as follows:
a) counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been
input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed);
b) number: The current digit input to the script;
c) largest: The largest number found so far.
