				<h1> Exercise 3.5 </h1>
				
				<p>Write an HTML5 element (or elements) to accomplish each of the following tasks:
					a) Students were asked to rate the food in the cafeteria on a scale of 1 to 10. Use a meter
					element with text to its left and right to indicate that the average rating was 7 out of 10.
					b) Create a details element that displays the summary text "Survey Results" for Part (a).
					When the user clicks the arrow next to the summary text, an explanatory paragraph about
					the survey should be displayed.
					c) Create a text input element for a first name. The element should automatically receive
					the focus when the form is rendered in a browser.
					d) Modify Part (c) to eliminate the label element and use placeholder text in the input
					element.
					e) Use a datalist to provide an autocomplete list for five states.
					f) Create a range input element that allows the user to select a number from 1 to 100.
					g) Specify that autocomplete should not be allowed for a form. Show only the form’s
					opening tag.
					h) Use a mark element to highlight the second sentence in the following paragraph.</p>
