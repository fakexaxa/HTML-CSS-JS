		<h1>Exercise 3.7(Creating an Autocomplete Form)</h1>
		
		<p>	Create a simple search form using a search input element
			in which the user can enter a search query. Using the Firefox web browser, test the form by
			entering January and submitting the form. Then enter a J in the input element to see previous entries
			that started with J -January should be displayed below the input element. Enter June and submit
			the form again. Now enter a J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J
			January and June should be displayed below the input element. Try this with your own search queries
			as well.
